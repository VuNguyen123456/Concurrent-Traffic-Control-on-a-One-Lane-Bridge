# Concurrent-Traffic-Control-on-a-One-Lane-Bridge
This project implements a **concurrent traffic control system** in Go that simulates vehicles crossing an imaginary **one-lane bridge**. Each vehicle is modeled as a **goroutine**, and synchronization is enforced using **mutex locks and condition variables** to guarantee safety, fairness, and efficiency.
